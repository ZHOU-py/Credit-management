# Credit risk management

This projet focus on credit risk management issues using advanced machine learning methods.  
* Understand the latest technology proposed in the literature and select a representative method of research  
* Python implements literature data and proposes improvements  
* The advantages and disadvantages of the bankâ€™s real data comparison method  
This projet mainly implements 5 methods based on SVM. Fuzzy SVM, Bilateral Fuzzy SVM, Least Suqare Fuzzy SVM, Bilateral Least Square Fuzzy SVM, Weighted Least Square SVM.  

## Deployment  

Combine FSVM, LSFSVM with integrated learning. Improve the robustness of the model while maintaining the high accuracy of Fuzzy SVM. And use three encoding methods according to the characteristic of qualitative variables, respectively ordinal encoding, additive encoding, one-hot encoding.
